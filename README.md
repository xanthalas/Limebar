# Limebar
Limebar is a Statusline bar for Windows (similar to Lemonbar on Linux).

It is a slim bar which spans the entire width of the screen and can be positioned at the top or bottom of the display.

Within the bar you can add as many panels as you like. Each panel will display some text or the date and time. The text can come from
the output of a command or a Powershell script.

Included with Limebar are a number of example scripts to show the current CPU usage, free memory and Battery status.

## Installation

Download the repository and unzip it into an empty directory.

## Running Limebar

Run Limebar.exe to start Limebar. By default it will look for a configuration file called config.json in the same directory as the Limebar executable. 

To start Limebar with a different configuration file simply pass it as a parameter to the excutable. For example:

    Limebar.exe alternate.json
